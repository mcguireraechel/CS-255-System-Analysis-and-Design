# CS-255





The client, DriverPass noticed that a large amount of students fail their driving tests due to a lack of available educational tools. In order to solve this problem DriverPass requested that a system be made that would allow students to take both practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. 

The part of the overall system design thay i felt i did best in was the business requirements documentation. Having a full, complete and detailed document was an extremely important step that aided in completing every other aspect of the system design. The business requirement document paints the overall picture of what the client wants in a systen as well as tells us what the functional/nonfunctional requirements are as well as any system limitations.

If i were to revise any piece of the system design it would be the sequence diagram in the system design document. While the diagram is a fairly good depiction of a login process, i believe it could look more organized so that its easier to read.

In consideration to what a user of the system may need i included a way to reset passwords and an option to pay in either debit or credit. The ability to reset passwords is really important to users, especially since their accounts may hold personal information. In the design I showed that a user may reset their passwords via email, which gives users security so their personal information is safe. Allowing for credit and debit payments also allow for more users to be able to pay for their driving courses since not every user will have one over the other. 
Its important to think about a users needs when designing a system because the client will not always mention the little things that are usually always implemented in other systems. If a user is having troubles with the system or its not "user friendly" then it can be costly for the clients business.

Designing software takes an incremental and iterative approach. One thing i made sure to do was look over the interview transcript many times while completing each section of the design so that nothing was missed along the way. The most important skill here is listening to the client and building accurate and detailed documentation.
